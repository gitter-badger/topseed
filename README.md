TopSeed aims to be a showcase of best practices and approaches for great looking webapps for developers and designers
who want to build stunning mobile-first web apps with some of the best technologies.

'TopSeed' features:
- DOM centric to be more friendly with team that includes interactive designers that code
- Page Transitions for SPA w/ SEO - all at the same time
- Static, serverless, deployed to CDN edge cache (fetch() microservices)
- PWA and AMP at same time, w/ re-use. First page served can be APM, that upgrades to PWA/interactive
- Support for Native Mobile Apps (phonegap/cordova)

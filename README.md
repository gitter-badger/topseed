Topseed aims to be a showcase of best practices and approaches for developers and designers who want to build stunning mobile-first web apps with some of the best technologies available now.

Some best practices demonstrated:
- DOM centric to be more friendly with team that includes interactive designers that code
- Using Page Transitions for a Single Page Application (SPA) feel that works with SEO
- Can be static (serverless), deployed to CDN edge cache to scale (fetch() microservices)
- Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) that can boost SEO, in same or separate subdomain
- Native Mobile Apps (Phonegap/Cordova) 
- Server side data-binding and in-browser data binding
- Use component libraries (such as Riot.js, Polymer, HTML 5.1 Standard Web Components)
- Use Material Design, SASS, and BEM Standard
- Use Pug to improve reuse and reduce maintenance costs.

- No magic, you see can how each part works, KISS.
